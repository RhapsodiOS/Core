ProjectBuilder Supplemental Makefiles

  These makefiles extend the functionality of the PB makefiles and corrects
some bogus assumptions made in the PB makefiles about how projects should
build.  Some things you get:

 - More predefined variables:
   - commands
   - path locations
 - Knows how to install man pages placed in the "Supporting Files" bucket
 - Corrects some assumptions about how projects should build
   - Not everyone wants ObjC in their frameworks
 - Handles tool projects which are shell scrips (no compiled code)
