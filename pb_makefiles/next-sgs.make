# If you use this, you're pretty much on your own.  If you must, however:
# 1) Put your source code in a directory named $(NAME).%d[.%d][.%d][%s]
# 2) Uncomment the preamble boilerplate:
#      OTHER_GENERATED_OFILES = $(VERS_OFILE)
# 3) Build your source "from clean" if you expect VERS_OFILE to be correct.
